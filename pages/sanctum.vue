  <h2>
    1. Validator staking
  </h2>

<p>
Staking is at the core of every blockchain based on the Proof Of Stake
mechanism.
  Solana is no exception. Staking is a principle where users of
the blockchain lend their tokens to validator servers. Validators are
computers verifying that every block (group of transactions) pushed to
Solana is valid and can be safely added to the
blockchain ledger.
</p>

<p>
The more a validator owns tokens, the more it is considered
as legit by the algorithm to
validate blocks. Every block validated by the validator is rewarded. So, the
more the validator validates transactions, the more fees it collects.
This system creates a strong incentive for validators to attract a lot of lenders.
</p>

<p>
To stake on a validator, you can use directly your wallet where a list of validators is available.
  They all have different settings: fees collected and total value locked.
  Validators with bigger amounts of SOLs tend to be safer but grab more fees
most of the time. It's up to you to find the right balance between safety and
rewards by using different validators.
</p>

<p>
Staking comes with rewards. All stakers get a share of the fees collected by
the validators. Every staked receives around 8% of the staked amount
on Average Per Year (APY). Rewards can be retrieved aside from unstaking.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Note: It leads to a secure blockchain because a validator compromising the chain
would lose all its tokens. The cost of an attack is too high to make it
interesting.
</em>
</p>

  <h2>
    2. Liquid staking
  </h2>

<p>
  Validation rewards are given to
validators every epoch (a defined amount of transactions validated). When the
rewards are given, the token can be released and new tokens can be locked.
The consequence is that staking tokens requires you to lock your
Solanas for 2 to 3 days (432000 slots).
From a user perspective, it makes the staking experience unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
That's where Liquid staking comes into play. Some protocols propose to aggregate
SOLs from many wallets and stake them for users in exchange for a token
  labeled by the protocol, a receipts token. Because the protocol collects
many native tokens, they can easily manage the in and out of the stakers.
  Moreover, they can use the most efficient strategy to stake the tokens (each
validator has their own characteristics, strategies are possible to get a
good balance). That way, they
can take a fee on staked tokens while providing a good APY to the user.
</p>

<p>
It improves a lot the user experience but it adds a layer that can be
compromised. And, it doesn't allow the user to select its validator. Validators
are often tied to non-LST projects.
</p>

<p>
It's common for Solana projects like JUP, Helium, Bonk to get their own validator.
  Because people want to be able to support the project while
keeping their sols, they like by staking their Sols on the project validator.
  With current Liquid Staking Providers, it's not possible to get the benefits
of liquid staking and select a favorite validator.
</p>

  <h2>
    3. Liquid staking for any project
  </h2>

<p>
This is where comes the Sanctum innovation. The Sanctum protocol allows any project to provide its
own liquid staking. That way, you can stake your sols into your favorite project
  validator while keeping the benefits of liquid staking. It's even better
    because you deal directly with the desired validator, thus, you limit the
  compromising risk of the LST token.
</p>

<p>
As an example, you can buy jupSols to stake on the Jupiter validator or buy
bonkSols to stake on the Bonk validator. You can support the Bonk team without
being exposed to the BONK volatility.
</p>

<p>
If you want to support Sanctum directly, you can use their own receipt token:
  the Infinity token ($INF).
INF acts as a classic LST token where they give you a receipt for managing your
staked sols for you. It comes with additional rewards from the fees used to
  trade Sanctum LSTs.
</p>

  <h2>
    4. Staking gamified (Wonderland)
  </h2>

<p>
To push things further, the Sanctum team decided to make staking fun. 18 of the
available LSTs tokens bring you point rewards in different buckets. Every
bucket is represented by a cute character gaining XP when you hold your
linked LST.
</p>

<p>
They also created community quests. On a
  regular basis, the community meets around a complex riddle and solves it
collaboratively. Once solved, extra point rewards are collected for a given set
  of LSTs.
</p>

<img class="illustration" src="~/assets/images/articles/sanctum/wonderland.png" />


  <h2>
    5. New value proposition for projects
  </h2>


<p>
We saw that Sanctum is already innovative and brings fresh air to the Solana
space through its gamification and branding. But these new features come with
an extra benefit for projects and SOL holders.
</p>

<p>
Projects like NFT marketplaces or lending protocols could allow to use of their
own LSTs instead of SOLs. Imagine that Tensor allows to trade NFTs with
tensorSOLs. It would allow you to bid and trade while still taking full
 advantage of the staking rewards and contributing to the Solana blockchain and
 the Tensor project. The same mechanism works for Kamino, Magic Eden,
   SharkyFi or any project requiring to use of your SOLs.
</p>

<img class="illustration" style="max-width: 400px;" src="~/assets/images/articles/sanctum/sanctum-guide-tensor.png" />

 <p>
This value could extend to individuals. If you like a creator, you could buy
their own LST token. All your staking rewards will go to this person. Let's
say Vitalik creates its own VitalikSOL token, it would allow you to reward him
by swapping your SOLs to his token. The first LST available following this
scheme is the fpSOL which is tied to the Sanctum founderc.
</p>


<h2>
6. How to get your LSTs
</h2>


<p>
Getting LSTs is pretty simple. You simply have to connect on the
<a href="https://app.sanctum.so/trade">Sanctum application</a> and trade your
SOLs to the LST token you want. The swapping system is the same as any
decentralized exchange.
</p>

<p>
Once done, the LSTs will appear in your wallet like any token. The SOL value of
your LST will grow over time allowing you to claim your rewards.
</p>

  <h2>
  7. Airdrop
  </h2>

<p>
  To motivate people to use Sanctum over other protocols, they organize an
  airdrop (season 2 running actually) rewarding staking of SOLs. The XP earned
  by your pets allows to participate and accumulate points. The quests are
  done in this context too. It makes things fun while providing extra rewards
  through their $CLOUD token.
</p>
<p>

</p>

  <h2>
  8. The $CLOUD token
  </h2>

<p>
Like any project, Sanctum will have its own governance token, named $CLOUD.
  This token will come with two particular utilities:

  <ul>
  <li>Voting power to accept or not new projects</li>
  <li>Access right for Sanctum partners</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
So, if you believe in Sanctum and want to invest in their token it's good
  news. Alongside the voting power you will get, it will create buying
pressure from the partners. So, the better the platform performs at expanding its
ecosystem, the scarcier the $CLOUD token will be.
</p>

  <h2>
  9. Available validators and LSTs of interests
  </h2>

<p>
To end this guide, I'm going to introduce you to the most interesting LSTs
available on Sanctum. Among the
<a href="https://app.sanctum.so/lsts">50 LSTs available</a> some caught my interest:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <strong>JupSOL</strong>: This is the receipt for the Jupiter Exchange
    validator. It offers one of the best APY (11%). It may be rewarded by the
  next JUP airdrop season.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>BonkSOL</strong>: It is tied to BONK the leading meme token on Solana.
    Bonk has yearly rewards. Holding some Bonk LSTs may be seen as a nice thing
  for the BONK community.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>WifSOL</strong>: Wif is the other leading meme of Solana. This LST is
  different because it rewards you with WIF instead of SOLs.
</li>
<li>
  <a href="https://www.pathfinders.gg/">PathSOL</a>: The Pathfinders is the most innovative project. They will
  create an NFT collection that will be only mintable with PathSOLs. NFT minted
  that way will always be tied to their LST. That way you will be able to
  un-mint the NFT if you are not satisfied anymore by their project.
</li>
<li>
  <a href="https://thevault.finance/">vSOL</a>: vSOL privilegiates new
  validators. It's a great
  token to help Solana get more decentralized. An upcoming airdrop is
  announced, owning it allow to contribute to it.
</li>
<li>
  <a href="https://drip.haus/">HausSOL</a>: It is the DRip project validator. Holding HausSols
  increases your chance of getting rare and legendary drip drops. You earn more
  droplets too. Allowing you to reward more artists from their platform.
</li>
<li>
  <a href="https://www.0xfp.com/introducing-fp-sol/">FpSol</a>: It is the
  validator of the Sanctum founder. All rewards get to him.
  It gives you access to a private channel in the Sanctum Discord.
</li>
</ul>

  <h2>
  10. Profiles
  </h2>

  <p>
Last but not least, Sanctum allows you to create profiles. This profile will
allow you to manage your Sanctum pet collections but not only. It will come
with some social benefits like:
  </p>

<ul>
<li>
Proposing your own LST.
</li>
<li>
Publishing content tied to your profile
</li>
<li>
Gating access to your content via your LST.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Allowing any creator to provide its LST is a big move forward for the Solana
 community. People will be able to contribute to the ecosystem while supporting
  their favorite artists and writers. It's a great way to nurture creativity
and builders.
</p>

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>

<p>
Sanctum's mission is to make all the staked tokens liquid. They want to create
more incentives to use on-chain protocols and to have more SOLs staked. It's
their way to push the decentralization and finance freedom further. To achieve
that they made Liquid staking an easy choice for Solana users.
</p>

<p>
Liquid Staking through Sanctum allows you to benefit from a strong yearly
reward rate while keeping your SOL investment liquid and supporting the project
  you like. Soon, it will also allow you to take advantage of the Solana
dApps while keeping your SOLs staked.
Even better, with their upcoming social features, they will allow you to reward
any creators. That way, the whole Solana ecosystem will benefit from the
Sanctum technology.
</p>

<p>
To foster adoption, the Sanctum ecosystem provides a gamified and fun experience.
It's easy to start with their LSTs and it comes with additional rewards.
  Nevertheless, it comes with drawback: it puts an additional layer that can be compromised.
  So,
if you are ready to handle those risks, I encourage you to explore staking
  through the Sanctum products. It will benefit to the ecosystem while
  giving you a smooth experience of the validator staking and allowing you to
grow your SOL holdings with a good risk/reward ratio.
